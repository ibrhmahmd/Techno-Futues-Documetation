# Footer Component Review & JS DOM Plan

## Review of Current Implementation

### Structure (from FooterTest.html)
- The footer is composed of two main sections:
  1. **Main Footer (`.footer`)**
      - **Logo & Slogan**: Image and a short text.
      - **Links**: Three columns (Company, Links, More), each with a heading and several links (some with Font Awesome icons).
      - **Social Icons**: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (as images).
  2. **Copyright Footer (`.footer2`)**
      - Simple centered copyright text.

- Uses Font Awesome for icons in links.
- Uses local images for logo and social icons.
- Responsive layout via flexbox and media queries.

### Styling (from FooterStyles.css)
- Uses `burlywood` as the main background color.
- Text color is mostly white, with some brown for links and details.
- Flexbox for layout, responsive adjustments for mobile.
- Hover effects for links and social icons.
- Custom font and spacing for a modern look.

## Plan for JS DOM-Only Footer Component

### Goals
- Recreate the footer so it can be injected into any HTML file by loading a JS file.
- No HTML for the footer in the host fileâ€”everything is created and styled via JS.
- Use only the following DOM APIs:
  - Element selection: `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`
  - Content: `textContent`, `innerHTML`
  - Creation: `createElement`, `appendChild`
  - Removal: `removeChild`
  - Styling: `.style`, `classList.add/remove/toggle`
  - Events: `addEventListener`
- The script should run as soon as it is loaded (no global function, no waiting for DOMContentLoaded).
- The footer should be appended directly to `document.body` (no specific container required).
- The code must be as simple as possible, using only the allowed DOM methods and no complex JS structures.

### Component Breakdown
1. **Footer Container**
   - `.footer` main div
2. **Footer Content**
   - `.footer-content` (flex container)
     - `.footer-logo` (logo image + slogan)
     - `.footer-links` (flex container)
       - Three `.footer-column` divs (Company, Links, More)
         - Each with heading and links (with icons)
3. **Social Icons**
   - `.social-icons2` (flex row of anchor tags with images)
4. **Copyright**
   - `<footer class="footer2">` with copyright text

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Inject Required Stylesheets
- Check if `<link rel="stylesheet" href="FooterStyles.css">` is present; if not, add it to `<head>`.
- Check if Font Awesome CDN `<link>` is present; if not, add it to `<head>`.

### Phase 2: Build Footer Structure with JS DOM
- Use only allowed DOM methods to create all elements for the footer.
- Set classes, attributes, and content as needed.
- Use `innerHTML` for Font Awesome `<i>` icons in links.
- Use `appendChild` to assemble the structure.

### Phase 3: Append Footer to Document
- Append the completed footer structure to `document.body`.
- Append the copyright `<footer>` after the main footer.

### Phase 4: Test and Verify
- Ensure the footer appears as expected when the JS file is loaded in any HTML file.
- Confirm that styles and icons load correctly.
- Check responsiveness by resizing the window.

**All phases must use only the allowed DOM methods and keep the code as simple as possible.**
