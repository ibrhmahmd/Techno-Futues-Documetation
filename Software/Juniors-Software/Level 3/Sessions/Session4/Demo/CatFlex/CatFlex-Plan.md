# CatFlex Game Plan

## Overview
CatFlex is an educational game designed to teach and test students' understanding of CSS Flexbox properties. The game features cat-themed elements that students must position correctly by writing CSS Flexbox code. The game progresses through multiple levels of increasing difficulty.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Interactive code editor where students can write CSS properties
2. Real-time application of CSS to the game elements
3. Progressive difficulty levels
4. Visual feedback on success/failure
5. Cat-themed design elements for engagement

### Flexbox Properties to Test
1. `flex-direction` (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse)
2. `align-items` (flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline)
3. `justify-content` (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly)

### Level Structure
- **Level 1**: Single property challenges (one property at a time)
- **Level 2**: Two property combinations
- **Level 3**: All three properties combined

## Game Design

### User Interface
- Split screen layout: code editor on one side, visual display on the other
- Cat-themed container elements that need to be positioned
- Clear instructions for each level/challenge
- Visual indicators for correct solutions

### Game Flow
1. Player is presented with a challenge (e.g., "Position the cats in a row at the center")
2. Player writes CSS code in the editor
3. CSS is applied in real-time to the container
4. When the correct position is achieved, player gets success feedback
5. Player advances to the next challenge

## Level Details

### Level 1: Single Property Challenges
1. **Challenge 1.1**: Use `flex-direction` to arrange cats in a row
2. **Challenge 1.2**: Use `flex-direction` to arrange cats in a column
3. **Challenge 1.3**: Use `justify-content` to center cats horizontally
4. **Challenge 1.4**: Use `align-items` to center cats vertically

### Level 2: Two Property Combinations
1. **Challenge 2.1**: Use `flex-direction` and `justify-content` to create a reversed row with space between cats
2. **Challenge 2.2**: Use `flex-direction` and `align-items` to create a column with cats aligned to the bottom
3. **Challenge 2.3**: Use `justify-content` and `align-items` to center cats both horizontally and vertically

### Level 3: All Properties Combined
1. **Challenge 3.1**: Create a reversed row with cats evenly spaced and aligned to the top
2. **Challenge 3.2**: Create a column with cats centered horizontally and with space around them vertically
3. **Challenge 3.3**: Final challenge combining all properties in a complex arrangement

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
```html
<div class="game-container">
  <div class="challenge-area">
    <div class="instructions"><!-- Challenge instructions --></div>
    <div class="flex-container" id="target-container">
      <!-- Cat elements will go here -->
      <div class="cat-item">ðŸ˜º</div>
      <div class="cat-item">ðŸ˜¸</div>
      <div class="cat-item">ðŸ˜¹</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="code-area">
    <div class="code-editor">
      <textarea id="css-input" placeholder="Write your CSS here..."></textarea>
    </div>
    <div class="feedback"><!-- Success/failure messages --></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS Base Styles
```css
.game-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
}

.challenge-area, .code-area {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 20px;
}

.flex-container {
  border: 2px dashed #333;
  height: 300px;
  /* The student will add flexbox properties here */
}

.cat-item {
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  background-color: #ffcc99;
  border-radius: 50%;
  font-size: 40px;
  /* Basic styling for cat elements */
}
```

### JavaScript Logic
- Parse user input from the code editor
- Apply CSS to the target container
- Check if the current arrangement matches the challenge requirements
- Provide feedback and track progress
- Manage level progression

## Questions for Clarification

1. Should the game include a timer or scoring system to add challenge?
2. Would you like to include hints or help features for students who get stuck?
3. Should there be a visual reference showing the target arrangement for each challenge?
4. Do you want to include any animations or sound effects for feedback?
5. Should the game save progress so students can continue later?
6. Would you like to include any additional CSS properties beyond the three main Flexbox properties?

## Next Steps

1. Create the basic HTML/CSS structure for the game interface
2. Implement the code editor with real-time CSS application
3. Design the cat-themed elements and container styling
4. Develop the challenge validation logic
5. Build the level progression system
6. Add visual feedback and success indicators
7. Test with sample users and refine based on feedback
