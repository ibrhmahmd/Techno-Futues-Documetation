# Session Documentation Plan

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Folder Structure & File Naming**
- Create the following directories and files:
  - `sessions/Session 1/Demo/session1-demo.html`
  - `sessions/Session 2/Demo/session2-demo.html`
  - `sessions/Session 3/Demo/session3-demo.html`
  - `sessions/Session 4/Demo/session4-demo.html`
  - `sessions/Session 5/Demo/session5-demo.html`
  - `sessions/Session 4/Docs/@Session 4.md`
  - `sessions/Session 5/Docs/@Session 5.md`
  - `sessions/Advanced Session/Docs/@Advanced Session.md`
- Place a shared `style.css` at `sessions/style.css` (if not already present).
- Ensure each Docs folder is ready to link to the shared stylesheet.

### **Phase 2: Documentation Template Setup**
- Add YAML frontmatter (title, author, date) to each new session markdown file.
- Insert section headers for topics, subtopics, code examples, practical exercise, and homework (bilingual placeholders).

### **Phase 3: Populate Content for Session 4**
- Fill in all topics, subtopics, code demos, explanations, practical exercise, and homework for Session 4 (Tables), in both English and Egyptian Arabic.
- Create and explain the code in `session4-demo.html` according to the session content.

### **Phase 4: Populate Content for Session 5**
- Fill in all topics, subtopics, code demos, explanations, practical exercise, and homework for Session 5 (Forms), in both English and Egyptian Arabic.
- Create and explain the code in `session5-demo.html` according to the session content.

### **Phase 5: Populate Content for Advanced Session**
- Fill in all topics, subtopics, code demos, explanations, practical exercise, and homework for the Advanced Session (Semantic HTML), in both English and Egyptian Arabic.

### **Phase 6: Populate Demo Files for Sessions 1-3**
- Create and explain the code in `session1-demo.html`, `session2-demo.html`, and `session3-demo.html` according to each session's content.

### **Phase 7: Final Review & Export**
- Review all markdown and demo files for consistency and completeness.
- Link each markdown file to the shared `style.css`.
- Export to PDF if needed.

**Next Step:**
Proceed with Phase 1: Create the required folder structure, empty markdown files, and demo HTML files for each session, and ensure the shared stylesheet is in place.

## 1. Directory & File Structure

For each session (starting from Session 4), create:

- `sessions/Session X/`
  - `Docs/`
    - `@Session X.md` (Markdown documentation, using the same template as `@Session 2.md` and `@Session 3.md`)
    - (Optional) `@Session X.pdf` (for export)

**Shared CSS:**
- Use a single shared `style.css` for all sessions, placed in a common location (e.g., `sessions/style.css`).
- Each session's Docs folder can link to this shared stylesheet.

**Example for Session 4:**
```
sessions/
  Session 4/
    Docs/
      @Session 4.md
  style.css  (shared)
```

## 2. Documentation Template

Each `@Session X.md` should follow the structure:
- YAML frontmatter (title, author, date — use same as previous sessions)
- Topics and subtopics (with English and Egyptian Arabic explanations)
- Code examples (HTML snippets)
- Practical exercise section (bilingual)
- Homework section (bilingual)

## 3. Content Outline for Each Session

### **Session 4: Tables**
- **Topic 1:** Basic Table Structure
  - Table, tr, td, th, thead, tbody, tfoot
  - Code demo and explanation (English + Arabic)
- **Topic 2:** Spanning Cells
  - colspan, rowspan, complex tables
  - Code demo and explanation
- **Topic 3:** Table Accessibility
  - Caption, scope, basic styling, accessibility
  - Code demo and explanation
- **Practical Exercise:** Create a table (e.g., weekly schedule) — English & Arabic
- **Homework:** Product comparison table with merged cells, headers, caption, and styling — English & Arabic

---

### **Session 5: Forms**
- **Topic 1:** Form Basics
  - form, input, label, required, placeholder
  - Code demo and explanation
- **Topic 2:** More Input Types
  - radio, checkbox, date, color, select, textarea
  - Code demo and explanation
- **Topic 3:** Form Organization
  - fieldset, legend, submit/reset, validation
  - Code demo and explanation
- **Practical Exercise:** Build a registration form — English & Arabic
- **Homework:** Registration form with 8+ input types, validation, fieldsets, and styling — English & Arabic

---

### **Advanced Session: Semantic HTML**
- **Topic 1:** Semantic Elements
  - header, footer, nav, main, article, section, aside, figure, figcaption, time
  - Accessibility and SEO
  - Code demo and explanation
- **Topic 2:** Embedding Content
  - iframe (YouTube, Maps), HTML entities, video tag
  - Code demo and explanation
- **Topic 3:** Final Project Planning
  - Multi-page site planning, wireframes, file organization
- **Practical Exercise:** Add semantic structure and embedded content — English & Arabic
- **Homework:** Plan and start a multi-page HTML-only website — English & Arabic

## 4. Steps to Implement

1. **Create directories** for each missing session (Session 4, Session 5, Advanced Session).
2. **Create Docs folder** inside each session directory.
3. **Create `@Session X.md`** in each Docs folder, using the template and content outline above.
4. **Link to the shared `style.css`** in each session's Docs folder.
5. **Export to PDF** if needed.

---

## 5. Implementation Decisions (per your answers)

- **File naming:** Use `@Session 4.md`, `@Session 5.md`, etc. (no issue with this convention)
- **CSS:** Use a single shared `style.css` for all sessions
- **Frontmatter:** Use the same author/date as previous sessions
- **Template:** No additional formatting/sections needed for now
- **Advanced Session Naming:** Use "Advanced Session" (not "Session 6") for folder and file names
- **Bilingual Content:** Practical exercise and homework sections must be in both English and Egyptian Arabic
