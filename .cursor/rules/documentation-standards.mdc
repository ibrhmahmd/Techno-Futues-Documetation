## Session Planning Structure
Each session follows this pattern:
1. **Review & Introduction** (15 min)
2. **Demo: I code** (20-30 min)
3. **Apply: You code** (15-20 min)
4. **Feedback and help** (ongoing)
5. **Wrap-up and homework** (10 min)

## Content Organization
- Group related sessions into logical modules
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Include cross-references between related topics
- Provide clear progression paths for different skill levels

## Assessment Documentation
- Include clear criteria for success
- Provide examples of expected outcomes
- Document common mistakes and solutions
- Include extension activities for advanced learners

## Template Usage
- Use [Doc Templates/](mdc:Doc Templates/) for consistent formatting
