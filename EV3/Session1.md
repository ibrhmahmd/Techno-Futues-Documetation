# EV3 Session 1

## Introduction

### What is EV3:
- LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is a programmable robotics kit that enables building and programming robots
- Uses a programmable brick (the "brain") to control motors and receive input from sensors
- Can be programmed with visual block-based language or text-based languages
- Designed for education and learning robotics fundamentals

### Why We Need Robots:
- Automation of repetitive or dangerous tasks
- Increased precision and accuracy in complex operations
- Exploration of environments hazardous to humans (space, deep sea, disaster zones)
- Enhanced productivity in manufacturing and industry
- Educational tools for learning programming, engineering, and problem-solving
- Assistance for people with disabilities or special needs
- Research platforms for advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning

### Needs for Robots:
- Power source (batteries, electricity)
- Control system (programming)
- Sensors for environmental awareness
- Motors for movement
- Physical structure/chassis
- Defined tasks/objectives

## Projects
- Alarm system
- Dancing robots
- Greeting robots
- Robotic sweeper

## Robot Parts
- Head (brick) - the programmable control unit
- Body - structural components
- Motors - provide movement
- Sensors (color, force, distance, etc.)
- Code - instructions for robot behavior

## Motor Types

### Large Motor Demo
- Power control
- Brake/coast options
- Settings for seconds/degrees/rotations

### Medium Block Motor
- Same capabilities as large
- Smaller size for compact designs

## Steering
- Steering degrees - how sharply the robot turns
- Power - speed control
- Rotations/seconds/degrees - movement measurement
- Brake/coast - stopping behavior options

## Technical Components
- EV3 Intelligent Brick: 300MHz processor, 64MB RAM, 16MB flash memory
- Sensors: Ultrasonic, Touch, Color, Gyroscopic
- Motors: Large (high torque) and Medium (faster response)
- Programming: LEGO Mindstorms Software or third-party options
- Connectivity: USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (with adapter)

## EV3 Ports
- Input Ports: 4 ports (numbered 1-4) located on top side of the brick
  - Used for connecting sensors (touch, color, ultrasonic, gyro, etc.)
  - Digital communication with RJ12 connectors
  - Sample rate up to 1000 samples per second

- Output Ports: 4 ports (labeled A, B, C, D) located on bottom side of the brick
  - Used for connecting motors and other output devices
  - Can control motor speed and direction
  - RJ12 connectors with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals
  - Supports rotation feedback from motors
