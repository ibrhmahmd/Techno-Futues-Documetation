# Junior Python Module Plan (15 Sessions)

Inspired by our JavaScript module structure, this roadmap is split into **three levels**, each containing **five sessions** that build foundational programming skills for total beginners (teens). Every session follows the same pattern:

1. **Review & Introduction** – recap previous lesson, set objectives
2. **Demo** – instructor-led code walkthroughs
3. **Apply** – guided hands-on exercises in the online IDE
4. **Homework** – small take-home practice task

Learners will code exclusively in a web-based IDE (e.g., Replit or CodeSandbox) so no local setup is required.

## Prerequisites
- Comfortable using a web browser and keyboard
- Completed HTML & CSS modules (optional but recommended for context)

## Level 1 – Programming Fundamentals (Sessions 1-5)

### Session 1: Getting Started with Python
**Demo**  
- Navigating the online IDE  
- `print()` statements & comments  
- Basic data types: integers, floats, strings  
**Apply** – Create a *Hello, Python!* program displaying name & age.  
**Homework** – Add decorative ASCII art using multi-line strings.

### Session 2: Variables, Input & Arithmetic
**Demo** – `input()`, variables, arithmetic operators, order of operations.  
**Apply** – Simple calculator.  
**Homework** – Temperature converter (°C ↔ °F).

### Session 3: Conditionals
**Demo** – `if`, `elif`, `else`, comparison & logical operators.  
**Apply** – Age-based movie rating checker.  
**Homework** – Even/odd number detector.

### Session 4: Loops
**Demo** – `while`, `for`, `range()`, `break`, `continue`.  
**Apply** – Number guessing game.  
**Homework** – Multiplication table generator.

### Session 5: Mini Project & Review
Combine topics 1-4 to build a *Simple Quiz* (questions stored in lists).  
Homework – Refactor quiz for at least 5 questions.

## Level 2 – Data Structures & Functions (Sessions 6-10)

### Session 6: Lists & Basic List Methods
Create, index, slice, mutate, `append`, `pop`, `len`.  
Homework – Grocery list manager.

### Session 7: Dictionaries & Tuples
Key-value pairs, nested dicts, tuples for constants.  
Homework – Student gradebook using a dictionary.

### Session 8: Functions
Defining functions, parameters, return values, scope.  
Homework – Function that checks prime numbers.

### Session 9: Combining Data Structures & Functions
Build a text-based *To-Do* app using functions + lists/dicts.  
Homework – Add “mark as done” feature.

### Session 10: Mid-Course Project
Capstone for Levels 1-2: *Text Adventure* game utilising loops, conditionals & functions.  
Homework – Add at least two extra rooms.

## Level 3 – Fun Projects & Real-World Uses (Sessions 11-15)

### Session 11: Cool Built-in Tricks
**What you’ll learn** – How to *import* built-in helpers like `random`, `time`, and `math`.  
**Mini-make** – Build a digital dice roller that shows random numbers.  
**Homework** – Make a *coin flip* program that counts heads/tails.

### Session 12: Drawing with Turtle
**What you’ll learn** – Use the friendly `turtle` module to move a pen on screen.  
**Mini-make** – Draw a colourful house using simple shapes.  
**Homework** – Draw your initials in turtle lines.

### Session 13: Turtle Race Game
**What you’ll learn** – Loops + turtle to animate movement.  
**Mini-make** – Code a turtle race where players guess the winner.  
**Homework** – Add a countdown timer before the race starts.

### Session 14: Saving & Loading Text
**What you’ll learn** – Write and read plain text files for scores or notes.  
**Mini-make** – Save the fastest turtle race time to a file.  
**Homework** – Make a *journal.txt* where kids can write a daily note.

### Session 15: Final Project & Celebration
**Goal** – Combine your favourite ideas into one small game or art piece.  
Examples: mini quiz that saves high scores, a multi-colour turtle drawing, or a story generator.  
We’ll share projects, give friendly feedback, and wrap up the course.​

## Assessment & Progression
- **Homework** after every session (short, auto-test friendly).  
- End-level mini projects (Sessions 5, 10, 15) showcase mastery and unlock the next level.

## Next Steps
1. Review this outline and suggest changes.  
2. Flesh out each session with timed agenda, demo code snippets, and starter templates.  
3. Prepare homework auto-grading or rubrics in the IDE.
